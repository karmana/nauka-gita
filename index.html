        <p>Here's a little song I wrote <br>
        You might want to sing it note for note<br> 
        Don't worry be happy<br> 
        In every life we have some trouble<br>
        When you worry you make it double <br>
        Don't worry, be happy</p>
        
        <p>Don't worry<br>
        Be happy<br>
        Don't worry, be happy<br>
        Don't worry<br>
        Be happy<br>
        Don't worry, be happy</p>
        
        <p>Ain't got no place to lay your head <br>
        Somebody came and took your bed<br>
        Don't worry, be happy <br>
        The land lord say your rent is late <br>
        He may have to litigate <br>
        Don't worry, be happy <br>
        (Look at me I am happy)</p>
        
        <p>Don't worry, be happy <br>
        Here I give you my phone number <br>
        When you worry call me<br>
        I make you happy</p> 
        
        <h3>Don't worry, be happy</h3>
